# Apache logs to RSS subscriber stats

A quick and dirty way to get subscriber stats by day from Apache access logs.

## Get started

Make sure you have node and npm installed.

Then: `npm install`

## Usage

You can run this with `node index.js input-file.log > output.html`

This script is also designed to be run directly and aliased from your bash profile. Once you give it execution rights, you can just run:

`./index.js input.log > output.html`
